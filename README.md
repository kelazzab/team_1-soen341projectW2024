## About the project

The project aims to develop a car rental web application leveraging a [Micro Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/microservices) architecture. 
This web is designed to streamline the vehicle rental process for short durations, typically from a 
few hours to several weeks. It functions as an intermediary between customers seeking to rent vehicles and the car 
rental companies providing those services. The application enables users to explore a variety of vehicle models 
available for rent, complete with descriptions, photos, and detailed specifications for each vehicle. Additionally, 
it offers a range of services to both users and rental providers, enhancing the rental experience and simplifying the 
transaction process.
